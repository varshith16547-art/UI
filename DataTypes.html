<script>// We have primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript
// Primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
// Non-primitive data types: object (arrays, functions, objects).

// ecmascript and JavaScript difference
// JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard.
// ECMAScript is a scripting language specification, 
//while JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
// All JavaScript engines (like V8, SpiderMonkey) implement the ECMAScript standard,
// but they may also include additional features and APIs beyond the standard.


// differencebetween var, let, const
// var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and updated.
// let is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope. 
// const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared. It must be initialized at the time of declaration.
// var and let allow variable hoisting, but let does not initialize the variable until its declaration
// const also does not allow hoisting in the same way as var.
// Use let and const to avoid issues with variable scope and redeclaration.
// Always use === for comparison to avoid type coercion issues..</script>
